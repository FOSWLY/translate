## Getting started

To start working with the API, you need to create a Translation Client. This can be done using the code provided below.

```ts
const client = new TranslationClient({
  service: TranslationService.yandexbrowser,
});

const translatedResult = await client.translate(
  "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog",
);

const detectResult = await client.detect(
  "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog",
);

const langs = await client.getLangs();
```
